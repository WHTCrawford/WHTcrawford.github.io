    The form statistic looks at the last two contests giving a score for each as above. We then create a weighted average for those contests by assigning a heavier weight to the most recent event.
 
The Wave Characteristic statistic looks at different aspects of a wave or spot such as sea bed characteristics and direction, size and weight of the wave. Then we look at how surfers have perfomed in contests at spots wth similar characteristics to the contest we are trying to predict, again giving a score for each contest. We then take a weighted average of all those contests, looking at data from the last four years.
 
The Spot Performance statistic simply looks at how a surfer has perfomed on that specific spot to try and capture more nuanced information than the Characteristic Performance metric is capable of providing. We again look at data from the last four years and weight for most recent to capture progression.
 
We then combine these three strands and rank the surfers. Then using our own personal knowledge of professional surfing we sense test our predictions and weed out any results that may be a consequence of missing data.
